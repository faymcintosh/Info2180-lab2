      May 11, 2011 will mark the 30th year since reggae icon Bob Marley transcended this life. 
      The Bob Marley Foundation and the Bob Marley Museum are making preparations to mark this occasion, 
      as are numerous organizations, radio and television programmes across the globe.
      International interest in commemorating Marley’s passing is not surprising.
      <br>
      <br>
      Since his passing, Marley’s legacy has surpassed mere fame as he represents far more than a pop legend.
      Ms. Jackie Lynch-Stewart, Manager of the Foundation and Museum, remarks that the Marley family promotes the 
      celebration of Bob Marley’s life and as such emphasis is usually placed on the commemoration of his birth.
      However, due to the significance of the 30th anniversary special arrangements will be made for the commemoration 
      of the date at the museum located on Hope Road.<p></p><hr>

      Ghana’s most-capped and top goalscoring player of all-time, Asamoah Gyan is undoubtedly The Black Stars’ greatest ever player. 
      His senior international debut came on 16th November 2003 at the age of 17.
      Gyan was then in his second season as a pro, and first at Italian side Udinese.
      <br>
      <br>
      Gyan scored on his debut, netting in the final minute of a 5-0-win versus Somalia. After making his mark in his first game, 
      the marksman became a regular in Ghana’s squad from that moment forward.
      Gyan had earned 10 caps by the end of 2005 and was scoring regularly for Ghana, with 8 goals scored in the caps earned.
      This guaranteed the striker’s place in his nation’s 2006 World Cup squad. At the World Cup, Gyan played 3 of his nation’s 4 games
      as Ghana reached the RO16 at their first-ever WC appearance.
